## 3 Typography Tips For A More Comfortable Read

### Tip 1 — Use Typographic Hierarchy To Give A Clear Sense Of The Structure Of A Page

All font sizes should be derived from the body text, as this is what will be most-read on each page. Here are a few simple steps to define your hierarchy.

- Body text: Increase or decrease the text size until it’s comfortable to read. For this article, let’s set it at 22pt.

- Primary heading: 180–200% of the body text, between 40–44pt

- Secondary heading: 130–150% of the body text, between 29–33pt

- Tertiary heading: 100–125% of the body text, between 22–28pt

- Small text / captions: 70–75% of the body text, between 15–17pt

## Tip 2 — Use Vertical Spacing To Make Your Words Easier To Scan

### Paragraph spacing

In most cases, it should be equal to the body text, so if the body text is 16pt then the paragraph spacing is 16pt.

- In design applications and CSS this is the equivalent of setting margin-bottom of paragraphs to 16px or 1em.

- In a Pages/Word document, set the ‘After paragraph’ value to the size of your body text.


### Line spacing

The line spacing should be set somewhere between 120–160% of the text size.
As a rule, the smaller the text, the more generous the line spacing needs to be to give each word room to breathe.

Tip: You should be able to fit a sideways ‘h’ between the lines without it hitting the tops of d/b/t’s (ascenders) or the bottoms of p/q/y’s (descenders).

- If the body text is 22pt, then the line-height of that text should be between 26–35px.

## Tip 3 — Adjust The Measure To Make Each Line Of Text More Comfortable To Read

The measure is the length of a line of text.
Long lines of text are difficult to read, with shorter lines being easier.
The ideal number of characters per line is 65–75.
The measure should be defined by the width of the body text rather than headings or sub-headings.
